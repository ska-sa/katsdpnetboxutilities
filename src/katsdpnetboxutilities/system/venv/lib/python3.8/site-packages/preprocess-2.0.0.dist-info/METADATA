There are millions of templating systems out there (most of them
developed for the web). This isn't one of those, though it does share
some basics: a markup syntax for templates that are processed to give
resultant text output.  The main difference with `preprocess.py` is
that its syntax is hidden in comments (whatever the syntax for comments
maybe in the target filetype) so that the file can still have valid
syntax. A comparison with the C preprocessor is more apt.

`preprocess.py` is targetted at build systems that deal with many
types of files. Languages for which it works include: C++, Python,
Perl, Tcl, XML, JavaScript, CSS, IDL, TeX, Fortran, PHP, Java, Shell
scripts (Bash, CSH, etc.) and C#. Preprocess is usable both as a
command line app and as a Python module.
